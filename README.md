<!-- Hero / Intro -->
I'm passionate about making privacy scalable and usable in blockchain and decentralized systems.  
Currently exploring **MPC**, **Zero-Knowledge proofs**, confidential compute, and how to bring institutional-grade privacy to public chains.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Confidential DeFi & institutional on-chain finance
- Educational content around ZK vs MPC and privacy tech generally 

### 🌱 I’m currently learning / deep-diving
- Advanced MPC protocols (threshold signatures, secret sharing optimizations)
- zk-SNARK/STARK implementations & circuit design
- Hybrid privacy systems (MPC + ZK + FHE)

### 📚 Popular content I’ve written
- [MPC vs ZK: When to Use What (Practical Guide)](https://medium.com/@vickysun207/mpc-vs-zk-when-to-use-what-540908a1b8ab)  
  A clear breakdown of when to choose MPC or ZK — and why they’re not interchangeable
